# WeatherForcasting
For forecasting weather using Python, we need a dataset containing historical weather data based on a particular location. I found a dataset on Kaggle based on the Daily weather data of New Delhi. We can use this dataset for the task of weather forecasting. You can download the dataset.

So this is how you can analyze and forecast the weather using Python.
Weather forecasting is the task of forecasting weather conditions for a given location and time. With the use of weather data and algorithms, it is possible to predict weather conditions for the next n number of days
